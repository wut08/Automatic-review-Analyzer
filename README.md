# Automatic-review-Analyzer

This project designed a classifier to use for sentiment analysis of product reviews as part of my coursework at MIT. 

Our training set consists of reviews written by Amazon customers for various food products. 

The reviews, originally given on a 5 point scale, have been adjusted to a +1 or -1 scale, representing a positive or negative review, respectively.

Three types of linear classifiers were implemented and compared: the perceptron algorithm, the average perceptron algorithm, and the Pegasos algorithm.
